Overview:

The restaurant industry is tougher than ever, with restaurant reviews blazing across the Internet from day one of a restaurant's opening. 
But as a lover of food, you and your friend decide to break into the industry and open up your own restaurant, Danielle's Delicious Delicacies. Since a restaurant's success is highly correlated 
with its reputation, you want to make sure Danielle's Delicious Delicacies has the best reviews on the most queried restaurant review site: Yelp! While you know your food will be delicious, 
you think there are other factors that play into a Yelp rating and will ultimately determine your business's success.

With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp ratings, you decide to use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating 
and predict the Yelp rating for your restaurant!


In this project we'll be working with a dataset provided by Yelp.

Yelp has been one of the most popular Internet rating and review sites for local businesses since its initial inception in 2004. 
Yelp founders saw that word-of-mouth was a powerful purveyor of new customers, but with the classic local community structure breaking apart in an online era, 
how could individuals know which businesses to trust? Yelp was the answer – an online review site in which customers shared their experiences, 
helping others make informed decisions about restaurants, auto-repair shops, and more.
